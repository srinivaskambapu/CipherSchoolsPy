Excel macros and VBA for automation
    Excel macros
        Macros in Excel are like shortcuts you record to automate boring, repetitive tasks. They save you time and effort!
    Macros Concepts
        Excel lets you train it! You can record the things you do a lot (like formatting dates or copying stuff around) and then have it do them automatically in the future.
    VBA (Visual Basic for Applications)
        Excel has some amazing superpowers beyond what you see on the surface.  VBA is like a secret language that lets you give Excel even more specific instructions. You could tell Excel exactly how you want something done, every step of the way.
    Macro vs VBA

    A macro is a piece of code.

    Macros are written in a programming language called VBA (Visual Basic for Applications).

    VBA stands for Visual Basic for Applications, which is used in Excel, Word, PowerPoint, and other Office applications.

    VBA includes an editor within Excel and Word for writing and managing macros.
