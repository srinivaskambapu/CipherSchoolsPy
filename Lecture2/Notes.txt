Intoduction to the Data Science Workflow notes:
1. Life Cycle Of Data Science
    1. Understanding the problem
        i. Define the objectives clearly
        ii. Determine how to measure the project's success
        iii. Identify the problem type
    2. Gathering Relevant Data
        i. Collect Data
        ii. Ensure data is Relevant
        iii. Consider the volume, variety, velocity and veracity of the data
    3. Data Preparation & Exploratory Data Analysis
        i. Clean the data
        ii.  Perform Exploratory Analysis to understand the data
        iii. Normalize or scale the data if necessary to preserve accuracy
    4. Feauture Engineering & Feauture Extraction
        i. Create new feautures that can help improve model performance
        ii. Reduce dimesionality if the feature space is too large.
        iii. Select the most important feautures to be used for modeling.
    5. Model Building & Deployment
        i. Choose appropriate algoriths and train models
        ii. Validate model performance using cross validation
        iii. Deploy the model for real time use or batch processing
