Principles of Data Visualization

What is Data Visualization?
    Data visualization is the process of presenting data in a visual format, such as charts, graphs, and maps. It helps data scientists and analysts understand and interpret complex data sets by making it easier to identify patterns, trends, and outliers. Visuals are often more intuitive and easier to understand than raw data or statistical models, making them useful for communicating findings to others.

Different Types of Plots
    Line Chart
    Bar Chart
    Pie Chart
    Histogram
    Scatter Plot: e.g., Productivity vs. Hours Worked
    Box Plot: e.g., Salaries by Department

Principles of Data Visualization
Principle 1: Clarity
            Avoid clutter.
            Use clear visual hierarchies.
Principle 2: Accessibility
            Use color schemes that are color-blind friendly.
            Ensure text is readable.
Principle 3: Accuracy
            Use appropriate scales and axes.
            Avoid misleading representations.
Principle 4: Relevance
            Tailor visualizations to the audience.
            Highlight the most important information.
Principle 5: Aesthetics
            Balance color and design elements.
            Use whitespace effectively.
Principle 6: Interaction
            Use interactive tools like hover and drill-down.
            Benefits of interaction include exploring data in more detail.
Principle 7: Context
            Keep the big picture in mind.
            Compare and contrast data points to provide context.
